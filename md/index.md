##The fwdpp home page

This is the homepage for __fwdpp__, which is a C++ template library for implementing forward-time population-genetic simulations.

###Source code

The library code is [here](https://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpp)

###Library documentation

* [Reference manual](doc/html/index.html) generated from the library source code.  The manual also contains a tutorial on writing policies for simulations.

### Google group

There is a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fwdpp-users) for fwdpp users.

###Citation

If you use __fwdpp__ for yor research, either to develop simulations or you use the example programs, please cite the following manuscript:

###Applications of fwdpp

The library has been used for the following projects:

* [foRward](https://github.com/molpopgen/foRward) is a testing ground for integrating fwdpp with [R](http://r-project.org) using [Rcpp](http://rcpp.org).

Early version of the code that eventually became __fwdpp__ were used in the following publications:

* [Thornton et al.](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003258) on modeling "rare alleles of large effect" and genome-wide association studies
* [Baldwin-Brown et al.](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/1040.full) on modeling "evolve and resequence" experiments"
